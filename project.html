                                                    animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people.

                                                    This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
                                                    The first infections were linked to a live animal market,
                                                    but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important
                                                    to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum.
                                                    Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other
                                                    viruses are less so.</p>

                                                rub or wash them with soap and water.
                                                <br>
                                                <strong>Why?</strong> Washing your hands with soap and water or

                                                <strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray
                                                small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which
                                                may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the
                                                droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person
                                                coughing has the disease.

                                                viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the
                                                virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter

                                            nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and
                                            begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any
                                            symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from
                                            the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every
                                            6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops

                                            likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and

                                            breathing should seek medical attention.
